## 10/18/2025 - Start the planning of the 3d printer  

This printer is the first one I've ever designed.
I would like this printer to be cantilever, small, use klipper, and be relatively cheap (-200$ if possible).
I've been thinking of going with 2020 aluminum extrusions, Nema 17 motors, Voron V0 bed, and linear rails 12 and 9 mm.

Sketch I did:
