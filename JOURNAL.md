## 10/18/2025 - Start the planning of the 3d printer  

This printer is the first one I've ever designed.
I would like this printer to be cantilever, small, use klipper, and be relatively cheap (-200$ if possible).
I've been thinking of going with 2020 aluminum extrusions, Nema 17 motors, Voron V0 bed, and linear rails 12 and 9 mm.

Sketch I did:

## 10/20/2025 - Change of plans  

I changed plans, and I think I will no longer go with a voron V0 bed. Mainly due to the hard mounting options, and also, the hard leveling. This is why I will go with a 150x150mm bed.
After quite a bit of research, I've found many parts which seem to fit the printer.
This is the current BOM:

## 10/22/2025 - Learn CFDOF with freecad  

Today I wanted to learn what was CFD and how to use, as I think this is going to be a necessary tool for my toolhead design. I wanted to use it with FreeCAD (the CAD software I use).
After quite a LOT of trial and error, I was able to get a basic simulation working.

I still have a lot to learn, but this is a good start

## 10/24/2025 - Do HotBed and create models  

I have been creating and importing models for my 3Dp. I've imported the extruder, hotend and SKR PICO.
I've also designed the bed and Y axis. I have yet to decide the dimensions of the Y axis, as well as the X and Z. I'll probably just design them, and then, later, resize them to the correct dimensions.

## 10/29/2025 6 PM - Finish bed motor mount, belt tensioner and start toolhead  

I just finished my completely overengineered motor mount and belt system.
It will use a NEMA 17 stepper motor (same motor will be used for all the other axis), and 2 pulleys to guide the belt through the correct paths.
I know there are WAY easier ways to route that, but I went too deep into the "cool" design.

I will now be designing the toolhead. Hope it works!

## 10/29/2025 7 PM - Finish toolhead  

I just finished the toolhead for my printer. It will use a 3010 fan to cool the heatsink, and 2x 4010 blower fans to cool the nozzle.
It will be powered by the [TZ E3 2.0 Hotend](https://es.aliexpress.com/item/1005008453023317.html), and [HGX Lite extruder](https://es.aliexpress.com/item/1005006950563760.html).
